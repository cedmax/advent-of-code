<h2>--- Day 3: Squares With Three Sides ---</h2><p>Now that you can think clearly, you move deeper into the labyrinth of hallways and office furniture that makes up this part of Easter Bunny HQ. This must be a graphic design department; the walls are covered in specifications for triangles.</p>
<p>Or are they?</p>
<p>The design document gives the side lengths of each triangle it describes, but... <code>5 10 25</code>?  Some of these aren&apos;t triangles. You can&apos;t help but mark the impossible ones.</p>
<p>In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be larger than the remaining side.  For example, the &quot;triangle&quot; given above is <span title="Unless it&apos;s on a sphere!">impossible</span>, because <code>5 + 10</code> is not larger than <code>25</code>.</p>
<p>In your puzzle input, <em>how many</em> of the listed triangles are <em>possible</em>?</p>
