<h2>--- Day 25: Let It Snow ---</h2><p>Merry Christmas!  Santa is booting up his weather machine; looks like you might get a <a href="1">white Christmas</a> after all.</p>
<p>The weather machine beeps!  On the console of the machine is a copy protection message asking you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_protection#Early_video_games">enter a code from the instruction manual</a>.  Apparently, it refuses to run unless you give it that code.  No problem; you&apos;ll just look up the code in the--</p>
<p>&quot;Ho ho ho&quot;, Santa ponders aloud.  &quot;I can&apos;t seem to find the manual.&quot;</p>
<p>You look up the support number for the manufacturer and give them a call.  Good thing, too - that 49th star wasn&apos;t going to earn itself.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that machine is quite old!&quot;, they tell you.  &quot;That model went out of support six minutes ago, and we just finished shredding all of the manuals.  I bet we can find you the code generation algorithm, though.&quot;</p>
<p>After putting you on hold for twenty minutes (your call is <em>very</em> important to them, it reminded you repeatedly), they finally find an engineer that remembers how the code system works.</p>
<p>The codes are printed on an <span title="The paper is very thin so it can be folded up neatly into the manual.">infinite sheet of paper</span>, starting in the top-left corner.  The codes are filled in by diagonals: starting with the first row with an empty first box, the codes are filled in diagonally up and to the right.  This process repeats until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor&apos;s_diagonal_argument">infinite paper is covered</a>.  So, the first few codes are filled in in this order:</p>
<pre><code>   | 1   2   3   4   5   6  
---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 1 |  1   3   6  10  15  21
 2 |  2   5   9  14  20
 3 |  4   8  13  19
 4 |  7  12  18
 5 | 11  17
 6 | 16
</code></pre>
<p>For example, the 12th code would be written to row <code>4</code>, column <code>2</code>; the 15th code would be written to row <code>1</code>, column <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>The voice on the other end of the phone continues with how the codes are actually generated.  The first code is <code>20151125</code>.  After that, each code is generated by taking the previous one, multiplying it by <code>252533</code>, and then keeping the remainder from dividing that value by <code>33554393</code>.</p>
<p>So, to find the second code (which ends up in row <code>2</code>, column <code>1</code>), start with the previous value, <code>20151125</code>.  Multiply it by <code>252533</code> to get <code>5088824049625</code>.  Then, divide that by <code>33554393</code>, which leaves a remainder of <code>31916031</code>.  That remainder is the second code.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;, says the voice.  &quot;It looks like we missed a scrap from one of the manuals.  Let me read it to you.&quot;  You write down his numbers:</p>
<pre><code>   |    1         2         3         4         5         6
---+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
 1 | 20151125  18749137  17289845  30943339  10071777  33511524
 2 | 31916031  21629792  16929656   7726640  15514188   4041754
 3 | 16080970   8057251   1601130   7981243  11661866  16474243
 4 | 24592653  32451966  21345942   9380097  10600672  31527494
 5 |    77061  17552253  28094349   6899651   9250759  31663883
 6 | 33071741   6796745  25397450  24659492   1534922  27995004
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;Now remember&quot;, the voice continues, &quot;that&apos;s not even all of the first few numbers; for example, you&apos;re missing the one at 7,1 that would come before 6,2.  But, it should be enough to let your-- oh, it&apos;s time for lunch!  Bye!&quot;  The call disconnects.</p>
<p>Santa looks nervous.  Your puzzle input contains the message on the machine&apos;s console.  <em>What code do you give the machine?</em></p>
