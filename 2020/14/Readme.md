<h2>--- Day 14: Docking Data ---</h2><p>As your ferry approaches the sea port, the captain asks for your help again. The computer system that runs this port isn&apos;t compatible with the docking program on the ferry, so the docking parameters aren&apos;t being correctly initialized in the docking program&apos;s memory.</p>
<p>After a brief inspection, you discover that the sea port&apos;s computer system uses a strange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)" target="_blank">bitmask</a> system in its initialization program. Although you don&apos;t have the correct decoder chip handy, you can emulate it in software!</p>
<p>The initialization program (your puzzle input) can either update the bitmask or write a value to memory.  Values and memory addresses are both 36-bit unsigned integers.  For example, ignoring bitmasks for a moment, a line like <code>mem[8] = 11</code> would write the value <code>11</code> to memory address <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>The bitmask is always given as a string of 36 bits, written with the most significant bit (representing <code>2^35</code>) on the left and the least significant bit (<code>2^0</code>, that is, the <code>1</code>s bit) on the right. The current bitmask is applied to values immediately before they are written to memory: a <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> overwrites the corresponding bit in the value, while an <code>X</code> leaves the bit in the value unchanged.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following program:</p>
<pre><code>mask = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X
mem[8] = 11
mem[7] = 101
mem[8] = 0
</code></pre>
<p>This program starts by specifying a bitmask (<code>mask = ....</code>). The mask it specifies will overwrite two bits in every written value: the <code>2</code>s bit is overwritten with <code>0</code>, and the <code>64</code>s bit is overwritten with <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The program then attempts to write the value <code>11</code> to memory address <code>8</code>. By expanding everything out to individual bits, the mask is applied as follows:</p>
<pre><code>value:  000000000000000000000000000000001011  (decimal 11)
mask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X
result: 00000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>0010<em>0</em>1  (decimal 73)
</code></pre>
<p>So, because of the mask, the value <code>73</code> is written to memory address <code>8</code> instead. Then, the program tries to write <code>101</code> to address <code>7</code>:</p>
<pre><code>value:  000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)
mask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X
result: 00000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>1001<em>0</em>1  (decimal 101)
</code></pre>
<p>This time, the mask has no effect, as the bits it overwrote were already the values the mask tried to set. Finally, the program tries to write <code>0</code> to address <code>8</code>:</p>
<pre><code>value:  000000000000000000000000000000000000  (decimal 0)
mask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X
result: 00000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>0000<em>0</em>0  (decimal 64)
</code></pre>
<p><code>64</code> is written to address <code>8</code> instead, overwriting the value that was there previously.</p>
<p>To initialize your ferry&apos;s docking program, you need the sum of all values left in memory after the initialization program completes. (The entire 36-bit address space begins initialized to the value <code>0</code> at every address.) In the above example, only two values in memory are not zero - <code>101</code> (at address <code>7</code>) and <code>64</code> (at address <code>8</code>) - producing a sum of <em><code>165</code></em>.</p>
<p>Execute the initialization program. <em>What is the sum of all values left in memory after it completes?</em></p>

<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>For some reason, the sea port&apos;s computer system still can&apos;t communicate with your ferry&apos;s docking program. It must be using <em>version 2</em> of the decoder chip!</p>
<p>A version 2 decoder chip doesn&apos;t modify the values being written at all.  Instead, it acts as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvfhANgLrm4" target="_blank">memory address decoder</a>. Immediately before a value is written to memory, each bit in the bitmask modifies the corresponding bit of the destination <em>memory address</em> in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the bitmask bit is <code>0</code>, the corresponding memory address bit is <em>unchanged</em>.</li>
<li>If the bitmask bit is <code>1</code>, the corresponding memory address bit is <em>overwritten with <code>1</code></em>.</li>
<li>If the bitmask bit is <code>X</code>, the corresponding memory address bit is <span title="Technically, since you&apos;re on a boat, they&apos;re all floating."><em>floating</em></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>floating</em> bit is not connected to anything and instead fluctuates unpredictably. In practice, this means the floating bits will take on <em>all possible values</em>, potentially causing many memory addresses to be written all at once!</p>
<p>For example, consider the following program:</p>
<pre><code>mask = 000000000000000000000000000000X1001X
mem[42] = 100
mask = 00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX
mem[26] = 1
</code></pre>
<p>When this program goes to write to memory address <code>42</code>, it first applies the bitmask:</p>
<pre><code>address: 000000000000000000000000000000101010  (decimal 42)
mask:    000000000000000000000000000000X1001X
result:  000000000000000000000000000000<em>X1</em>10<em>1X</em>
</code></pre>
<p>After applying the mask, four bits are overwritten, three of which are different, and two of which are <em>floating</em>. Floating bits take on every possible combination of values; with two floating bits, four actual memory addresses are written:</p>
<pre><code>000000000000000000000000000000<em>0</em>1101<em>0</em>  (decimal 26)
000000000000000000000000000000<em>0</em>1101<em>1</em>  (decimal 27)
000000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>1101<em>0</em>  (decimal 58)
000000000000000000000000000000<em>1</em>1101<em>1</em>  (decimal 59)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, the program is about to write to memory address <code>26</code> with a different bitmask:</p>
<pre><code>address: 000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)
mask:    00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX
result:  00000000000000000000000000000001<em>X</em>0<em>XX</em>
</code></pre>
<p>This results in an address with three floating bits, causing writes to <em>eight</em> memory addresses:</p>
<pre><code>00000000000000000000000000000001<em>0</em>0<em>00</em>  (decimal 16)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>0</em>0<em>01</em>  (decimal 17)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>0</em>0<em>10</em>  (decimal 18)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>0</em>0<em>11</em>  (decimal 19)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>1</em>0<em>00</em>  (decimal 24)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>1</em>0<em>01</em>  (decimal 25)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>1</em>0<em>10</em>  (decimal 26)
00000000000000000000000000000001<em>1</em>0<em>11</em>  (decimal 27)
</code></pre>
<p>The entire 36-bit address space still begins initialized to the value 0 at every address, and you still need the sum of all values left in memory at the end of the program.  In this example, the sum is <em><code>208</code></em>.</p>
<p>Execute the initialization program using an emulator for a version 2 decoder chip. <em>What is the sum of all values left in memory after it completes?</em></p>
